# UNavMaze: Maze Solver App

## Display the Shortest Path in Weighted Mazes Effortlessly
UNavMaze quickly gives visualizations of the shortest path for mazes. Simply provide a csv file as input and the application will display the shortest path for you.

## Using UNavMaze
In order to use UNavMaze, first create a csv file for the maze.
- Include a start point by placing "S" in a cell.
- Include an end point by placing "E" in a cell.
- Weighted cells can be denoted by using integers.
- Empty cells automatically default to a weight of 1.

After providing the csv input to UNavMaze, the app will output the visualization of the maze with the calculated path from the start point to the end point as a png file.
